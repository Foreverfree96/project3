This is the code for project 3 open classrooms.
The website is live @ https://foreverfree96.github.io/project3/

The technologies I used on this project: Css animations including heart fill animation, loading spinner, flexbox to adjust positioning, added checkmark to spin and slide smoothly.
Created media queries for a mobile, tablet and desktop versions.
Added hover effects to lighten color on mouse over.
as well as animated the opacity on html pages 1-4 not including the home page to appear and move up slowly.
added footer with mailto tag to directly email.
